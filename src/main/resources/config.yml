                                      # 🛡️ Example: A 30-min item won't drop to 30 sec if picked up by
                                      # someone on Hardcore.

  ownershipTransferThreshold: 30      # ⏱️ Number of seconds a player must hold an item before they
                                      # are considered the *new* legitimate owner.
                                      # 🧠 Why 30 seconds is the default?
                                      #   This value strikes a balance between fairness and protection:
                                      #   - Long enough to prevent abuse like "bouncing" an item off
                                      #     an easier difficulty player to gain a longer despawn timer.
                                      #   - Short enough to allow legitimate transfers (e.g., gifting,
                                      #     returning dropped items) to still work as expected.
                                      # ✅ This prevents abuse like bouncing an item off a player with
                                      # easier difficulty just to get a longer despawn time.
                                      # Example: If Player A (Hard) drops an item and Player B (Easy)
                                      # picks it up then re-drops it after 5s, the timer will not be upgraded.
